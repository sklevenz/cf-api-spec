# custom-ruleset.yaml
# This ruleset extends the default 'spectral:oas' ruleset.
# Spectral requires a valid ruleset with defined rules or an extension of an existing ruleset.
# Without this definition, an error is triggered because Spectral doesnâ€™t know which rules to apply.
# In this case, we extend the default 'spectral:oas' ruleset to ensure the standard rules for
# OpenAPI documents are applied.
# Additionally, you can define custom rules or modify (disable, adjust) existing ones here.
