      The time the resource was created. 

      Timestamps generally appear in created_at and updated_at fields on
      resources. 

      Precision beyond seconds is not supported, even if the underlying database
      supports it (e.g. Postgres). 

      As a result, filtering on sub-second timestamps is not allowed.

      All v3 timestamps have the following format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ.
