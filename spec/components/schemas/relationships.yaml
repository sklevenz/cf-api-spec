  Relationships represent associations between resources. When relationships are
  mutable, they can be used to create, read, update, and delete these
  associations. An app’s relationship to its current droplet is mutable, but an
  app’s relationship to its space is not.


  Relationships do not affect the fundamental properties of a resource, but may
  affect their behavior and permissions logic. Relationships are tied to the
  lifecycles of the associated resources and will be removed if either of the
  associated resources are deleted. For example, if a user is removed from an
  organization, both the user and the organization persist, but the relationship
  between them does not.


  Not all resources implement every relationship operation demonstrated in the
  examples below. See the docs for each resource to see how it interacts with
  its relationships.


  Endpoints that return relationship data list this information under the
  relationships key.


  The relationship object

  The relationship object is a key-value pair that uniquely identifies a
  resource. In practice this is almost always the guid of a resource.
