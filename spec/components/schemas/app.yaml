  Apps represent the core entities in the Cloud Foundry environment. They are
  the deployable units that run your code. Each app can have multiple processes,
  routes, and services associated with it. Apps can be scaled horizontally by
  increasing the number of instances. They can also be updated and restarted as
  needed.
