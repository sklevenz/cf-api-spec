  Deployments are objects that manage updates to applications with zero
  downtime. They can either: - Manage updating an appâ€™s droplet directly after
  an application package is staged - Roll an app back to a specific revision
  along with its associated droplet

  Deployment strategies supported: - Rolling deployments allow for applications
  to be deployed without incurring downtime by gradually rolling out instances.
  Max-in-flight can be configured to specify how many instances are rolled out
  simultaneously. - Canary deployments deploy a single instance and pause for
  user evaluation. If the canary instance is deemed successful, the deployment
  can be resumed via the continue action. The deployment then continues like a
  rolling deployment. This feature is experimental and is subject to change.
