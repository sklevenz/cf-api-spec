description: >
  Selectors allow users to filter and group API resources by the labels applied
  to them. A selector consists of one or more requirements in a comma-delimited
  list. The maximum number of requirements in a single selector is 50.


  Example label selector:

  `cf curl
  /v3/apps?label_selector=env=dev,%21chargeback-code,tier%20in%20%28backend,worker%29`


  Selectors can be used to filter and group resources using the query parameter
  `label_selector` on list endpoints.


  When included in a URL, the selector must be appropriately escaped.


  A requirement consists of a key, an operator, and optional value(s).
