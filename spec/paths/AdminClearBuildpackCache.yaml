  summary: Clear the buildpack cache
  description: This endpoint will delete all of the existing buildpack caches in the blobstore. The buildpack cache is used during staging by buildpacks as a way to cache certain resources, e.g. downloaded Ruby gems. An admin who wants to decrease the size of their blobstore could use this endpoint to delete unnecessary blobs.
