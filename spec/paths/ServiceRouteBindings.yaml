    summary: Delete a service route binding
    description: This endpoint deletes a service route binding. When deleting route
      bindings originating from user provided service instances, the delete operation
      does not require interactions with service brokers, therefore the API will respond
      synchronously to the delete request. Consequently, deleting route bindings from
      managed service instances responds with a job which can be used to track the
      progress of the delete operation.
