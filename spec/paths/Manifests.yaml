    summary: Apply a manifest to a space
    description: 'Apply changes specified in a manifest to the named apps and their
      underlying processes. The apps must reside in the space. These changes are additive
      and will not modify any unspecified properties or remove any existing environment
      variables, app features, routes, or services.


      Apply manifest will only trigger an immediate update for the “instances” property
      or routing changes. All other properties require an app restart to take effect.'
