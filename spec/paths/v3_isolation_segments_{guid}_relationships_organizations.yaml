  summary: Entitle organizations for isolation segment
  description: >-
    This endpoint entitles the specified organizations for the isolation
    segment. In the case where the specified isolation segment is the
    system-wide shared segment, and if an organization is not already entitled
    for any other isolation segment, then the shared isolation segment
    automatically gets assigned as the default for that organization.
