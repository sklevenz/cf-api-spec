    summary: Create a user
    description: 'Creating a user requires one value, a GUID. This creates a user
      in the Cloud Controller database.


      Generally, the GUID should match the GUID of an already-created user in the
      UAA database, though this is not required. Creating a user by guid is only permitted
      by admins.


      If CAPI property `cc.allow_user_creation_by_org_manager` is enabled, a UAA user
      will be automatically created if it does not exist yet. The UAA user will be
      only created when `username` and `origin` have been provided instead of a guid.
      Additionally `origin` must be different from `uaa`. Admins and OrgManagers can
      make use of the UAA user creation.'
