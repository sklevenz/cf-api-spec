    summary: Clear buildpack cache for application
    description: This endpoint will delete the buildpack cache for a specified app.
      The buildpack cache is used during staging by buildpacks as a way to cache certain
      resources, e.g. downloaded Ruby gems. A user may want to use this endpoint when
      an app doesn’t stage anymore due to out-of-disk caused by a large buildpack
      cache content.
