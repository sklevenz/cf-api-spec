    summary: Create a role
    description: 'This endpoint creates a new role for a user in an organization or
      space.


      To create an organization role you must be an admin or organization manager
      in the organization associated with the role.


      To create a space role you must be an admin, an organization manager in the
      parent organization of the space associated with the role, or a space manager
      in the space associated with the role.


      For a user to be assigned a space role, the user must already have an organization
      role in the parent organization.


      If the associated user is valid but does not exist in Cloud Controller’s database,
      a user resource will be created automatically.


      If CAPI property `cc.allow_user_creation_by_org_manager` is enabled, the organization
      role is being created by username + origin and the user does not exist in UAA
      yet, the user will be created. The origin must be different from `uaa` in this
      case.'
