  summary: Purge and seed app usage events
  description: |-
    Destroys all existing events. Populates new usage events, one for each
    started app. All populated events will have a created_at value of
    current time. There is the potential race condition if apps are
    currently being started, stopped, or scaled. The seeded usage events
    will have the same guid as the app.
