    # Welcome to the Cloud Foundry V3 API docs! Version 3 adds support for
    several key features:


    - Running one-off tasks on Cloud Foundry

    - Applications consisting of several processes via a Procfile

    - Direct access to application packages and droplets

    - Changing application source code without stopping the app via deployments


    # Getting help

    The CAPI team can most easily be reached on our Slack channel for questions
    and issues regarding the API. To report an issue with the docs or API,
    please feel free to file a GitHub issue on our API repo,
    cloud_controller_ng.

    We recommend reaching out to Slack first as we will be most responsive
    there.

      Apps represent the core entities in the Cloud Foundry environment. They
      are the deployable units that run your code. Each app can have multiple
      processes, routes, and services associated with it. Apps can be scaled
      horizontally by increasing the number of instances. They can also be
      updated and restarted as needed. The lifecycle of an app includes stages
      such as staging, starting, running, and stopping. Apps can be managed
      through various endpoints that allow for creation, updating, deletion, and
      retrieval of app details.
